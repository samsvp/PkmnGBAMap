MEH is a Generation III Map Editor for Pokemon Fire Red, Leaf Green, Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald games for the GameBoy Advance. Currently it is hardcoded to Pokemon Fire Red but INI/YAML support will be added in the near future. Keep in mind that this is a WIP and that it does nothing but analyze data and output them in a structured manner. As time goes on more features will be added to make it a more complete and bug-free map editor than current options such as A-Map and EliteMap.

**Dependencies:**

* Java 1.6
* GBAUtils (available on my repository)

**Credits:**
* **Linkandzelda** - for his GBA IO from Titlescreen Cry Editor
* **Shiny Quagsire** and **interdpth** - for being #2awesome4advancecrap
* **Bela** - Graphics
